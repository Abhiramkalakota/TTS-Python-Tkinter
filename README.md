# TTS-Python-Tkinter
# 🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS) using Python and Tkinter

This is my **first beginner project** using Python and Tkinter.  
It’s a simple **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** application that converts input text to speech using male or female voice options.

I followed a YouTube tutorial to build and understand the basic structure of GUI apps in Python.
