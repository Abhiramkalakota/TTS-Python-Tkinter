# TTS-Python-Tkinter
# 🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS) using Python and Tkinter

This is my **first beginner project** using Python and Tkinter.

I followed a YouTube tutorial to build and understand the basic structure of GUI apps in Python.

## 🔧 Features
- GUI made with Tkinter
- Text-to-Speech using `pyttsx3`

- Beginner-friendly code

## 📚 Tutorial Credit
I learned this project by watching a tutorial from:
